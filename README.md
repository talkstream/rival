Dispatch prompts to external AI CLIs from Claude Code. Run GPT-5.5 via Codex, Gemini 3.1 Pro via Gemini CLI, or Claude Opus 4.6 (1M) via Claude Code CLI — as isolated subagents that keep your main context clean.

## Install

### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew install 1F47E/tap/rival
rival install
```

### From source

```bash
cd rival && make install
rival install
```

> **Note:** `go install` is not supported due to the repo's subdirectory layout. Use Homebrew or build from source.

`rival install` copies the Claude Code skills (embedded in the binary) into `~/.claude/skills/`. After that, `/rival-review`, `/rival-codex-only`, `/rival-gemini-only`, and `/rival-claude-only` are available in Claude Code.

Use `rival install --force` to overwrite without prompting.

### Prerequisites

- [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex): `npm install -g @openai/codex` + `codex login`
- [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli): `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` + set `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview): install + authenticate (or use Docker — see below)

You only need the CLIs for the commands you use. Megareview uses all available CLIs.

## Usage

### Claude Code Skills

**Default review** (runs all available CLIs + consilium judge):

```
/rival-review                              — review with ALL CLIs (auto-detects changed files)
/rival-review src/api/                     — review specific scope (bypasses git detection)
/rival-review -re xhigh src/api/           — all CLIs, max reasoning effort
```

**Single-CLI skills** (use only when you want one specific CLI):

```
/rival-codex-only explain the auth flow in this project
/rival-codex-only -re xhigh find bugs in src/main.go
/rival-codex-only review                   — review (auto-detects changed files via git)
/rival-codex-only review src/api/          — review specific scope
```

```
/rival-gemini-only explain the auth flow
/rival-gemini-only -re high analyze this complex algorithm
/rival-gemini-only review                  — review (auto-detects changed files via git)
/rival-gemini-only review src/api/         — review specific scope
```

```
/rival-claude-only explain the auth flow
/rival-claude-only -re xhigh find code quality issues in src/
/rival-claude-only review                  — review (auto-detects changed files via git)
/rival-claude-only review src/api/         — review specific scope
```

**Reasoning effort** (`-re`): `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` (default)

### How Reviews Work

When you run a review, Codex/Gemini/Claude get **full access to your project**. They don't just see a diff — they run as CLI tools inside your workdir with tool use enabled, so they can:

- Read any file in the project
- Follow imports and trace dependencies
- Explore the full codebase to understand context
- Run commands to inspect project structure

**Smart scope detection.** Running `/rival-review` with no arguments auto-detects what to review via git:
1. **Dirty files** (staged + unstaged + untracked new files) → reviews those files
2. **Last commit** (if working tree is clean) → reviews files from HEAD
3. **Full project** → only if not a git repo or no changes found

The **scope** is a focus hint, not a restriction. `review src/api/` tells the reviewer to focus on `src/api/`, but it can (and will) read other files to understand the code in context. Explicit scope bypasses git detection entirely.

This means you can use natural language for the scope:

```
/rival-codex-only review the files changed in the last commit
/rival-codex-only review the authentication middleware
/rival-review -re xhigh the new payment flow in src/billing/
```

The reviewer will figure out what to look at, explore the relevant code, and give you a review with full project understanding.

### Roles & Consilium (megareview)

Megareview assigns **specialized roles** to each reviewer:

- **Codex → Bug Hunter** — finds concrete code-level defects: logic bugs, broken state transitions, race conditions, missing edge cases. Optimizes for true positives with high confidence.
- **Gemini → Architecture & Security** — attacks from angles a bug hunter misses: architectural regressions, broken cross-file flows, incomplete refactors, concurrency issues, security problems, silent failure gaps.
- **Claude → Code Quality & DX** — focuses on readability, naming, unnecessary complexity, error message quality, API ergonomics, maintainability traps, developer footguns, and dead code.

All reviewers emit **structured JSON** with file, line, severity, category, confidence (1-10), and fix suggestions.

Role prompts can be customized via `~/.rival/config.yaml`:

```yaml
roles:
  bug_hunter: |
    Your custom bug hunter instructions...
  code_quality: |
    Your custom code quality instructions...
```

A third **consilium judge** (runs via Codex) then:
- Merges duplicate findings (same file + line + problem → single finding with all reporters in `found_by`)
- Applies consensus bonus (+2 confidence for findings reported by 2+ reviewers)
- Filters by confidence threshold (default: ≥6)
- Sorts by severity (critical first), then confidence
- Produces a unified verdict: `approve`, `request_changes`, or `comment`

```
═══ RIVAL REVIEW ═══

Summary: ...

[CRITICAL] file.go:42 — Title
  Description...
  Fix: ...
  Found by: codex, gemini

[HIGH] file.go:100 — Title
  ...

Recommendation: request_changes — ...

Reviewed by: codex (bug_hunter), gemini (arch_security), claude (code_quality)
Judge: codex (consilium)
Findings: 5 (threshold: 6)
```

If only one CLI is available, the consilium judge falls back to whichever CLI is present. If a reviewer fails to produce structured JSON, the consilium receives a stub with a 2KB debug tail instead of the full raw output (prevents prompt overflow).

### Direct CLI

```bash
# Run with prompt from stdin
echo 'explain the auth flow' | rival command codex --workdir .
echo 'explain the auth flow' | rival command gemini --workdir .
echo 'explain the auth flow' | rival command claude --workdir .

# Review via megareview (all CLIs in parallel)
echo 'src/api/' | rival command megareview --workdir .
```

### TUI Dashboard

Monitor running and past sessions in a full-screen terminal UI:

```bash
rival tui
```

**List view** shows all sessions with status, CLI (◈ codex / ✦ gemini / ⬡ claude / ◈✦⬡ mega), model, effort, elapsed time, workdir, and prompt preview. Megareview sessions are grouped into a single row. Claude sessions show `⬡ claude` for native or `⬡ claude/dk` for Docker mode.

**Detail view** shows full metadata (including Mode and Account/subscription type for Claude), prompt, and live-streaming log output. For megareview groups, all reviewer logs are shown.

#### Keys

| Key | List View | Detail View |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| `j/k` or `↑/↓` | Navigate sessions | — |
| `Enter` | Open detail view | — |
| `Esc` | — | Back to list |
| `g` / `G` | Jump to top / bottom | — |
| `p` | — | Toggle full prompt |
| `o` | — | Open log file in editor |
| `x` | — | Kill running session |
| `q` | Quit | Quit |

### Session Management

```bash
rival sessions              # all sessions as JSON
rival version               # show version
```

## Architecture

```
Claude Code main session
    │
    │ /rival-review
    ▼
Claude skill (context: fork)
    │
    │ stdin heredoc → rival command megareview --workdir $(pwd)
    ▼
rival binary
    ├─ parses arguments (-re flag, review/prompt mode)
    ├─ builds review prompt with scope injection
    ├─ spawns codex/gemini/claude via subprocess
    ├─ pipes prompt to stdin, tees stdout to log file
    ├─ writes session JSON + live log to ~/.rival/sessions/
    └─ returns output to skill → back to Claude Code

Megareview (roles + consilium):
    rival binary
    ├─ generates shared GroupID (UUID)
    ├─ assigns roles: codex=bug_hunter, gemini=arch_security, claude=code_quality
    ├─ spawns all available CLIs concurrently with role-specific prompts
    ├─ parses structured JSON output from each reviewer
    ├─ spawns codex again as consilium judge
    │   ├─ merges duplicates, applies consensus bonus
    │   ├─ filters by confidence threshold (≥6)
    │   └─ produces unified verdict with found_by attribution
    ├─ prints formatted review to stdout
    └─ TUI groups all sessions by GroupID

Second terminal:
    rival tui
      ├─ watches ~/.rival/sessions/ via fsnotify (.json + .log)
      ├─ groups sessions by GroupID for megareview display
      ├─ live-refreshes every second while sessions are running
      └─ x key sends SIGTERM to kill stuck sessions
```

### Key design decisions

- **Full project access**: reviewers run as AI CLI tools with tool use — they explore your codebase, not just diffs
- **Isolated execution**: skills use `context: fork` — runs in subagent, zero impact on your Claude context
- **Stdin piping**: prompts passed via heredoc, never shell-quoted into argv (prevents injection)
- **Env filtering**: child processes get a sanitized environment (blocks proxy/preload vars from .env)
- **Fault tolerant**: megareview continues if one CLI fails, reports the error inline
- **Consilium overflow protection**: reviewer outputs that fail JSON parsing are replaced with a stub + 2KB debug tail, preventing oversized judge prompts

## Claude: Native vs Docker

Claude auto-detects its execution mode:

- **Native** (default): if `claude` CLI is on PATH, uses it directly. No extra config needed.
- **Docker**: if `claude` CLI is not available, runs inside a Docker container with a separate Anthropic subscription.

### Docker Setup

1. Build the image (auto-builds on first run, or manually):
   ```bash
   docker build -t rival-claude -f - . <<'EOF'
   FROM node:22-slim
   RUN npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code && \
       useradd -m -s /bin/bash claude
   USER claude
   WORKDIR /workspace
   ENTRYPOINT ["claude"]
   EOF
   ```

2. Authenticate via interactive login in a temp container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name rival-claude-login --user claude --entrypoint sh rival-claude -c 'sleep 3600'
   docker exec -it rival-claude-login claude login
   # Opens auth URL → authorize in browser → paste localhost redirect back
   docker exec rival-claude-login cat /home/claude/.claude/.credentials.json
   # Copy the accessToken value (starts with sk-ant-oat01-...)
   docker rm -f rival-claude-login
   ```

3. Export the token:
   ```bash
   export RIVAL_CLAUDE_TOKEN=sk-ant-oat01-YOUR-TOKEN-HERE
   ```

4. Optionally set subscription type in `~/.rival/config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   claude:
     subscription: team    # or "personal" — shown in TUI
   ```

### Notes

- OAuth tokens expire — re-run the login flow if you get 401 errors
- The Docker image runs as non-root user `claude` (required by Claude CLI)
- Your workdir is mounted as `/workspace` inside the container
- To rebuild: `docker rmi rival-claude`, next run rebuilds automatically
- TUI shows `⬡ claude/dk` for Docker sessions, `⬡ claude` for native

## Models

| CLI | Model | Default Effort |
|-----|-------|---------------|
| Codex | `gpt-5.5` | xhigh |
| Gemini | `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | xhigh |
| Claude | `claude-opus-4-6[1m]` | max |

## Privacy

rival ships anonymous telemetry on by default (Sentry crash reports + PostHog
session metadata: OS, arch, CLI used, model, effort, duration, exit code,
truncated error message). No file contents, no prompts, no reviewer outputs.

A short notice prints to stderr on the first telemetry-enabled run and is then
silenced via a marker file at `~/.rival/.telemetry-notice-shown`.

Opt out by setting any one of:

```bash
export DO_NOT_TRACK=1
export RIVAL_NO_TELEMETRY=1
# or run in CI (the CI env var auto-disables telemetry)
```

To re-show the notice on the next run, delete the marker:

```bash
rm ~/.rival/.telemetry-notice-shown
```

## Uninstall

```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/rival-codex-only ~/.claude/skills/rival-gemini-only ~/.claude/skills/rival-claude-only ~/.claude/skills/rival-review
brew uninstall rival        # if installed via brew
# or: rm "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/rival"   # if installed from source
```
